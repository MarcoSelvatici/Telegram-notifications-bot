# Telegram-notifications-bot
This telegram bot sends you a message when you recieve an Instagram or a Facebook notifications.<br>
It creates 3 new threads for every user that control the presence of new notifications every prefixed time (described by the global variable "interval").<br>
It uses phantomJS broswer, that is a browser without an UI (so it can run much quicker).<br>
Currently the bot is offline since I do not have a server, however, you can find it on telegram searching @ms_notification_bot.
If you want to use it please contact me.
